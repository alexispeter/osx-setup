2. Follow instructions to install OS X
3. Encrypt disk ("System Preferences" > "Security & Privacy" > "FileVault")

Migrate data from your previous computer

- Copy `~/.ssh/`
- Copy `~/Projects/`

Install Xcode
-------------
Trigger the Xcode installer:
```
xcrun --version
```

Run the installer
-----------------
Base installation:
```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/cargomedia/osx-setup/master/install.sh | bash
```

DNS server:
```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/cargomedia/osx-setup/master/install.sh | ROLE=dns bash

Java

Java is not installed by default because of an issue with PhpStorm (won't boot) that prefers to
install its best JDK at first launch. Install Java manually if needed:
```bash
brew cask install java
```
